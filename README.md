# Testing_Automation

The file clicks.py contains code for automating mouse clicks. The value within the forloop can be changed depending 
on the desired number of clicks. This file however does not take into considration the position of the mouse pointer, and this 
needs to be set manually for now.

To be able to run the file do the following:

1) install and import the the library pyautogui
2) run the pyrhon file clicks.py
